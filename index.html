        <h3>Information</h3>
        <p>
          This E39 M5 is owned by my buddy Rongchang, it is painted in a shade
          of paint known as "Lemans Blue", the model year of this car is 2001
          and it has almost 200,000 miles on the dashboard. These cars only came
          in a 6 speed transmission, they are a true driver's car.
        </p>
        <h3>Benchmarks</h3>
        <ol>
          <li style="font-size: 8px; color: red">
            The E39 M5 is powered by the BMW S62 V8 engine, which generates a
            power output of 294 kW (400 PS; 394 hp) at 6,600 rpm and 500 N⋅m
            (369 lb⋅ft) of torque at 3,800 rpm.
          </li>
          <li style="font-size: 18px; color: rgb(0, 60, 255)">
            The transmission is the Getrag 420G six-speed manual, as used in the
            E39 540i but with an upgraded clutch due to the increased torque.
          </li>
          <li style="font-size: 28px; color: rgb(4, 107, 38)">
            The E39 M5 uses aluminium-intensive MacPherson strut front
            suspension and multi-link rear suspension, as per the other V8
            models of the E39 5 Series range.

          paint known as "Long Beach Blue", the model year of this car is 2018
          and it has under 100,000 miles on the dashboard.
        </p>
        <h3>Benchmarks</h3>
        <ol>
          <li style="font-size: 200%; color: rgb(255, 0, 204)">

            N⋅m (343 lb⋅ft) between 1,450 and 4,750 rpm, while an overboost
            function temporarily increases torque to 500 N⋅m (369 lb⋅ft).
          </li>
          <li style="font-size: 150%; color: rgb(0, 179, 255)">

        <h3>Information</h3>

        <ol>
          <li style="font-size: 4mm; color: rgb(112, 174, 228)">
            The M3 model of the E90/E92/E93 3 Series range was powered by the
            BMW S65 V8 engine and was produced in sedan, convertible and coupé
            body styles. The E9x is the first and only standard production M3
            powered by a V8 engine. In the standard M3, the S65 engine rated at
            309 kW (420 PS; 414 hp) at 8,300 rpm[99] and 400 N⋅m (295 lb⋅ft) at

            In April 2008, the E90/E92/E93 M3 became the first BMW to be
            available with a dual-clutch transmission when the 7-speed Getrag
            "M-DCT" transmission was introduced as an option.
